## Personal portfolio website

This is my second attempt to create a portfolio website, 1st is available [Here](https://akshaygautam.tk/) <br>
Special thanks to all my friends from [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) and specifically @Fayd (on slack) whose workshop on creating hamburger icon for making website responsive was very helpful.

Major difference from previous website is:
- this site is responsive
- Single page with three sections
- used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
- My favourite color scheme.
- images are from [Unspalsh](https://unsplash.com/)

----
#### Used

- HTML5 for markup
- CSS for styling
- Jquery to make header animation effects work (just a bit)
- JavaScript to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices
