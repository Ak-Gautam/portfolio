## Personal portfolio website

This is my second attempt to create a portfolio website, 1st is available [Here](https://akshaygautam.tk/) <br>
Special thanks to all my friends from [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/).

This version is a complete overhaul focusing on a modern, premium, and minimalist design.

Major upgrades from the previous design:
- Complete redesign with a clean, light theme and a new color palette.
- Modern typography using Google Fonts (Montserrat & Source Sans Pro).
- Fully responsive layout with a two-column hero section.
- Dynamic scroll animations using the Intersection Observer API.
- All interactions are now powered by vanilla JavaScript (no more jQuery!).
- Images are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
